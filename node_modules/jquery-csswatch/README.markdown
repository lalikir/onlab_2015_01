With jQuery css-watch, you can watch css changes

It uses requestAnimationFrame _(webkitRequestAnimationFrame, mozRequestAnimationFrame, oRequestAnimationFrame, msRequestAnimationFrame)_ for polling and verifying if any changes to the CSS has been made for the given CSS attributes. It falls back to a timer in case the browser doesn't support requestAnimationFrame.

## Documentation ##
For now, please see the tests and examples

## Usage ##
This is both released as a bower component and a npm module, to suit whatever build tool/env you are using for your frontend.

Using npm
```
npm install jquery-csswatch
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="../node_modules/execute_method/dist/execute_method.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../node_modules/jquery-csswatch/dist/jquery-csswatch.js"></script>
```

Using bower




## Building ##
You need to setup grunt + npm to develop/build
```
  # install dependencies
  npm install

  # Build library, run unit tests and create minified version
  grunt

```

## Examples ##
A working example can be found here:
See [http://leifcr.github.com/jquery-csswatch/examples/](http://leifcr.github.com/jquery-csswatch/examples/)

## Requirements ##

* jQuery 1.8+

* execute_method (http://github.com/leifcr/execute_method)

##### For building:

* CoffeeScript 1.4 + (For building the library)


## Development ##
Development is made in chrome and firefox on jQuery 1.8.2. Please fork, make a feature or bugfix branch and request a pull request. I'm sure there are bugs to be hunted down.

## Testing ##
The library and unit tests needs to be built before testing. Direct compilation of coffeescript fails in some rare cases, and it's therefore better to compile before testing.

Currently these jQuery versions and browsers has been tested:

### jQuery Versions ###
